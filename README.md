 1) What is node.js? We had to download node,js in order for us to download the nesscary tools locally to configure jest via commands above. 
   It is neither a framework or a librar. Essentially, it is a running time enviorment that allows us to runs js on a server (rather than it being locally on our machine) where it allows us 
   to use a node package manager. Again, it is this node package manager through node.js, that allows us to configure jest! 

   If it isn't obvious, the NPM comes with node.js. As a result, NPM is considered as the default package manager for Node.js. The NPM allows us to install Libraries
   and frameworks like (express, react, lodash, etc]);
